# Personal_Projects
I first used an Open Source dataset provided by IBM in order to predict Customer Churn. As this was an case of predictive classification I used various Supervised Learning Model with Data
that I Pre-processed and Analysed to best suit the requirements of the model and our objective.Even after making the models I used various evaluation metrics in Order to find the best
of the above.

#Data Extraction 
I used an open Source Dataset Provided on Kaggle

#Feature Selection
I used chi-square test in order to find the best features in order to train the model as the features earlier were categorical values. I used Label Encoder in order to Convert categorical 
values to usable numerical value

#EDA 
I used graphs and plot in order to analyze tha dataset and also correlation coffeciant 

#Model Building 
I used decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM in order to BUild the Model

#Model Testing
I used Accuracy score, fi score, log loss and jaccard score to evaluate the models
